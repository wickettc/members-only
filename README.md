Member's Only

A project created with Express for the Odin Project. This will be a blog website for "member's only".
Well not completely, anyone can view the blog posts, however the author will not be visible without becoming a member first. There will also be an admin member who is able to delete posts.
This will be my first full stack site that includes a log-in feature!
