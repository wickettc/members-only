Member's Only

Live App:

A project created with Express for the Odin Project. This will be a blog website for "member's only".
Well not completely, anyone can view the blog posts, however the author will not be visible without becoming a member first. There will also be an admin member who is able to delete posts.
This will be my first full stack site that includes a log-in feature!

To become an admin sign in, in the navbar click on welcome 'your name', and enter 'becomeadmintoday'. You will then be able to delete posts!

This project was my first dealing with authentication, using PassportJS I learned how to authenticate a user, save a cookie to the session and keep track of whether or not a user was logged in. The next step was displaying a different interface based off whether of not the user is logged in. To accomplish the different interfaces, I used pug, a view template engine. Pug provided a great developer experience and allowed me to create a dynamic page quite quickly. Finally, I used MongoDB to store the posts in a database. I used Mongoose as my ODM to quickly and easily communicate with the database. This project was a great learning experience and helped me expand my developer knowlege to the backend!
